# CJMCU-2232HL

This is a FT2232 breakout board I found on AliExpress (https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/32898010758.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.d8a5b90avJR3QS). FT2232 is a dual channel multiprotocol SUB-serial converter provided by FTDI (https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT2232H.html). It has two multi-protocol synchronous serial engines (MPSSEs) which allow for communication using JTAG, I2C and SPI on two channels simultaneously. Mine came with unsoldered pin header bars.
